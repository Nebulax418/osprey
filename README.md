Osprey is a comprehensive math library writte in java that has multiple functions as an extension of the few readily available math functions in the normal Math.java class. It has functionalities such as calculating, creating, identifying geometric and arithmetic sequences, 
multiple useful algorithms for sorting, searching, and finding, also it has prime number factorization, number theory operations such as finding GCF, LCM, and etc... as well
as a statistics package where functions like mode, median, mean, and other functions are available. In geometry there are perimeters, areas, and other angle functions of 2D shapes. 
There is also volume, and surface area for 3D shapes as well. A logarithms section and converter is available for huge number of conversions from blood sugar conversions to currency conversions.
Also, there is a radical and exponent class where square roots, cube roots, and even custom roots/exponents can be calculated. The trigonometry package has normal trig functions, inverse trig functions, hyperbolic trig functions, 
and inverse hyperbolic trig functions for a comprehensive and complete trig package. Even rounding will be easier as many methods are implemented to simplify rounding. This is just 
a short readme covering all the functions, documentation for this library will be made, and future notice will be given for when it will be done, still in work though....
